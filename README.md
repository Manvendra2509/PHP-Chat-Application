## Description:
It is a PHP Chat Application in which admins can only chat with users and vice versa. Admins have access to 'Add Users' page which they can use to add more users to the chat application and assign their roles.
The chat updates in realtime using AJAX requests, all the messages have an assigned timestamp and the last seen status of a particular user can also be viewed.

## Future Plans:
- Implementing a chat log for admins in which the login and logout activity of a particular user is stored. Clicking on a particular session will display the chat logs of that particular session.
- Implementing a settings panel to allow users to change their Profile Picture, Name and other things.
